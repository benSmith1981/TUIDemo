# TUIDemo
I wrote it trying to think about principles of TDD so that it was easy to test methods as you can inject important variables the state of the datalayer is also kept local , no Singleton, so can be tested more easily. 

Used access levels to indicate to programmers what should be exposed and what should not and I used update functions incase external variables need to be changed.

Other than that I used MVC pattern and tried to keep the code clean, name variables and functions properly so clear what they do and stick to a single responsibility principles that functions and classes should do one thing, as much as possible.
